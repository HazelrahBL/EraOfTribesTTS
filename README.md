Credits
------------------------------

Huge thanks to Arne Lorenz for not only creating a fantastic civ game, but also
for giving permission to create this mod and providing high quality asset
images!

This Tabletop Simulator mod was adapted from the original Era of Tribes Scripted
mod based on Arne's prototype:

Most of the credit for this mod goes to Kijan's original work developing that
mod. This original version is archived in the repo and tagged as v0.1.0.

Hazelrah started with Kijan's mod and used Arne's updated assets to update the
mod to the published version.


Making Contributions
------------------------------

I haven't really figured this part out yet. If you are interested in helping,
please contact Arne, he can give you my contact and we can work it out
together.


Reference files
------------------------------

Files in the `/reference` directory are those `ttslua` and `xml` files exported
to the Atom text editor. The contents is entirely contained within the base
`EoT_TTS.json` file, but it is easier to look at the diffs when they are in
individual files.
