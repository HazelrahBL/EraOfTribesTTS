Credits
------------------------------

Huge thanks to Arne Lorenz for not only creating a fantastic civ game, but also
for giving permission to create this mod and providing high quality asset
images!

This Tabletop Simulator mod was adapted from the original Era of Tribes Scripted
mod based on Arne's prototype:

Most of the credit for this mod goes to Kijan's original work developing that
mod. I, Hazelrah, merely took Kijan's mod and Arne's updated assets to update
the mod to the published version.

Support files
------------------------------

### Reference files

Files in the `/reference` directory are those `ttslua` and `xml` files exported
to the Atom text editor. The contents is entirely contained within the base
`EoT_TTS.json` file, but it is easier to look at the diffs when they are in
individual files.

### Utils

This directory contains utilities which were written to help set the board up
properly but are not needed in the actual mod.
